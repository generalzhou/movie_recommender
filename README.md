##Movie Recommender

This is a WIP machine learning project I started while at Dev Bootcamp. This program uses movie rating data from http://www.grouplens.org/node/73 to generate similarity scores between movies. This score is used to determine how likely you are to like movie 2 if you like movie 1, and is calculated using a method called Pearson Correlation.
